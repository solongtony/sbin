My essential Shell Scripts

Many of these scripts are targeted at making scripts on your path instantly accessable.

`new` - create a new executable script in "$HOME/sbin".

`launch` - run a command with nohup and in the background, redirecting output.

`wcat` - show the contents of a script on the path.

`wls` - show details about an executable on the path.

`wvim` - open a script on the path in vim for editing.

There are also scripts to help use vim securely. These scripts must be used with the home/.vimrc file.

`pvim` - private vim, turns off various features which would log or create a record of what you are editing.

`evim` - create or open an encrypted file in vim.
