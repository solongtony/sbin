# My Lenovo has certain problems with the touchpad when running Linux
# Some discussion here
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1791427

# One says disabling the finger print reader in BIOS caused the problem.

# One uses
#echo -n "none" | sudo tee /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio1/drvctl
#echo -n "reconnect" | sudo tee /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio1/drvctl

# This works for me, although I have to run it each time the problems start.
sudo modprobe -r psmouse
sudo modprobe psmouse
