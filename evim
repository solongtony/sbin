# Encrypted vim

# Use this to creat encrypted files in vim.
# To resume editing an encrypted file you can just use `vim`
# and it will ask for a key, although with efault options
# your buffer may be saved in plain text various places.
# To securily edit an encrypted or unencrypted file,
# use `pvim` or the equivalent `VIM_PRIVATE=1 vim`
# Cypher and other security / privacy important options set in .vimrc

# Example .vimrc
# set cm=blowfish2    " The only available secure cypher
#" Ensure private editing.
#" Usage - VIM_PRIVATE=1 vim
#if $VIM_PRIVATE
#  set nobackup
#  set nowritebackup
#  set noundofile
#  set noswapfile
#  set viminfo=""
#  set noshelltemp
#  set history=0
#  set nomodeline
#  set secure
#endif

# -x is for encyption
# -n is for no swap file (which is an unencrypted copy of your buffer)
